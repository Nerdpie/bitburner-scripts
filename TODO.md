# Repo general
- Convert files to TypeScript 
- Refine the tsconfig.json, .editorconfig
- Define .eslintrc.cjs
- Review the rest of the settings/definition files, e.g. `package.json`
- Determine why some inspections get stuck so badly

# Game general
- Determine what BitNodes to tackle first
- Determine what challenges to try
- Write a routine that goes through all eligible servers, and pushes them to 100% money, min sec

# Contracts to code:
- Caesar cypher offset
- Hamming codes
- Overlapping sets
- Number of paths
- Shortest path
- Matching parentheses

# Script changes
- Research script autocompletion options - https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src/blob/633da383016ad0521f9f1c17cdd99478d2701e41/src/Terminal/getTabCompletionPossibilities.ts#L290
- Evaluate making the pattern that sets up a tail window a library function
- Tweak `find_server` to show ALL servers in hierarchy, annotate pwned hosts
- Write script to show servers with contracts in a hierarchy
- Check the different array functions, such as `unshift`
- Adjust `contract_dispatcher` to have a tail window by default.
