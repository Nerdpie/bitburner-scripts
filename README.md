# Bitburner Scripts

This repository holds my scripts for the open-source hacking game, Bitburner.

## Usage

While it is encouraged to try your own scripts, if you want to use mine verbatim, follow these steps.
!! As with any scripts, ensure you know what they are doing, or otherwise trust the source completely! !!

1. Ensure that you have a new enough version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed; the template recommends at least v20.

3. Open a terminal or console to the `bitburner-scripts` folder
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
5. Run `npm start` to start the Remote API server
